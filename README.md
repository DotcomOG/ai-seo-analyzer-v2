# AI SEO Analyzer v2

This project provides a simple demonstration of using OpenAI to generate SEO
insights for a given website. It consists of a small Express server and a
static frontâ€‘end served from the `public/` directory.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application will be available on `http://localhost:3000` by default.
